## Course challenge
1. **Scenario 1, questions 1-9**

   You have been working as a junior data analyst at Bowling Green Business Intelligence for nearly a year. Your supervisor, Kate, tells you that she believes you are ready for more responsibility. She asks you to lead an upcoming client presentation. You will be responsible for creating the data story, identifying the right tools to use, building the slideshow, and delivering the presentation to stakeholders.
   <br/><br/>
   Your client is Gaea, an automotive manufacturer that makes eco-friendly electric cars. For the past year, you have been working with the data team in Gaea’s Bowling Green, Kentucky, headquarters. For the presentation, you will engage the data team, as well as its regional sales representatives and distributors. Your presentation will inform their business strategy for the next three-to-five years.
   <br/><br/>
   You begin by getting together with your team to discuss the data story you want to tell. You know the first step in data storytelling is to engage your audience. 
   <br/><br/>
   **A big part of audience engagement is knowing how to eliminate less important details. What practice do you use to scan quickly through the data in order to identify the most important insights?**
   ```
   Spotlighting
   ```

2. **Scenario 1, continued**

   After you identify the most important insights, it’s time to create your primary message. Your team’s analysis has revealed three key insights:
   <br/><br/>
   1.  Electric vehicle sales demand is expected to grow by more than 400% by 2025.
   <br/><br/>
   2.  The number of publicly available vehicle charging stations is a significant factor in consumer buying decisions. Currently, there are many locations with so few charging stations that electric car owners would run out of power when traveling between stations. 
   <br/><br/>
   3.  Vehicle battery range is also a significant factor for consumers. In 2020, the average battery range was 210 miles. However, the vast majority of survey respondents report they will not buy an electric car until the battery range is at least 300 miles per charge.
   <br/><br/>

   **Based on these insights, you create your primary message. Which of the following reflect the expectations of a primary message?**

   ```
   Although electric vehicle sales demand is on the rise, low availability of charging stations and short battery range are significant hurdles that Gaea must overcome.
   ```

3. **Scenario 1, continued**

   Next, you decide on your data narrative’s characters, setting, plot, big reveal, and aha moment. During the narrative, you want to communicate to your stakeholders about the challenges associated with the current lack of vehicle charging stations and why it's important for Gaea to increase its cars’ battery range by 2025. 
   <br/><br/>
   **In which part of your data narrative would you include information about charging stations, the need to increase battery range, and why it’s important for Gaea to increase its cars’ battery range?**
   ```
   Plot
   ```

4. **Scenario 1, continued**

   Now, it’s time to consider which tools to use to create data visualizations that will clearly communicate the results of your analysis. You and your team decide to make both spreadsheet charts and Tableau data visualizations. In addition, you agree to build a dashboard to share live, incoming data with your stakeholders.  This will help them achieve the following goals:
   <br/><br/>
   -   Organize multiple datasets about electric vehicle battery ranges into a central location
   <br/><br/>
   -   Enable tracking and analysis of electric vehicle data
   <br/><br/>
   -   Simplify data visualizations about the number of available charging stations using maps of the different geographies 
   <br/><br/>
   
   **Another key benefit of dashboards is that they enable you to maintain control of your data narrative.**
   ```
   False
   ```

5. **Scenario 1, continued**

   Now that you have finished planning the data story with your team, it’s time to create data visualizations. First, you consider electric vehicle sales worldwide in 2015 compared to 2020. You use a spreadsheet to create the following bar graph to compare the two values:
   <br/><br/>
   ![A bar graph representing electric vehicle sales worldwide in 2015 compared to 2020. There are no x-axis or y-axis labels.](/images/Course-challenge/4oFa634oQM-BWut-KIDPyQ_49c2c590c36c4b9586b2a27ba159ea5c_unnamed.png)
   <br/><br/>
   **You want to add labels so the graph is easier to interpret. Where on the graph do you label the time periods?**
   ```
   The x-axis
   ```

6. **Scenario 1, continued**
   
   Next, you explore how access to public car-charging stations is influencing electric vehicle purchases. As your analysis has revealed, there are many areas without enough places for people to plug in and charge their cars. This lack of charging stations has a negative impact on demand for electric cars and overall vehicle sales. 
   <br/><br/>
   You use Tableau to create the following draft of a visualization, which organizes the charging station data geographically:
   <br/><br/>
   ![The visualization represents the United States map, each state is a different color. The text is blurry and colors are faded](/images/Course-challenge/W1HdjZJHQ1SR3Y2SR4NURQ_22bbeb251a9a40588ae04f002d81807a_pasted-image-0.png)
   <br/><br/>
   After reviewing your draft, you realize that it could be improved. 
   <br/><br/>
   **Fill in the blank: To improve your draft, you select more varied hues and make the color intensity stronger. In addition, you choose darker _____ in order to reflect more light.**
   ```
   values
   ```

7. **Scenario 1, continued**

   Now, you want to highlight what your team’s analysis discovered about the number of charging stations available compared to the number of cars purchased. Your data has confirmed that the lack of charging stations causes the effect of fewer car sales. To communicate this effectively, you will need to convey causation to the stakeholders.
   <br/><br/>
   **How do you explain causation?**
   ```
   Causation is when an action directly leads to an outcome, such as a cause-effect relationship. In the case of Gaea’s business, the lack of charging stations directly leads to the outcome of fewer car sales.
   ```

8. **Scenario 1, continued**

   Once you finish creating data visualizations about the current state of the electric vehicle market, you turn to projections for the future. You want to communicate to stakeholders about the importance of longer vehicle battery range to consumers.
   <br/><br/>
   Your team’s data includes feedback from a consumer survey that investigated the importance of longer battery when choosing whether to purchase an electric car. The current average battery range is about 210 miles. By 2025, that range is expected to grow to 450 miles per charge.
   <br/><br/>
   You create the following pie chart:
   <br/><br/>
   ![A circular chart of survey responses of miles per charge it would take surveyors to purchase an electric vehicle.](/images/Course-challenge/28eac38a-f267-49e8-8f3d-7fcc03073571image4.png)
   <br/><br/>
   **After reviewing your pie chart, you realize that it could be improved by resizing the segments. Resizing the segments in proportion to each segment's relative value enables you to visually show the different values.**
   ```
   True
   ```

9. **Scenario 1, continued**

   It’s time to build your Tableau dashboard for stakeholders. You consider what type of layout to use. 
   <br/><br/>
   **You decide that you want to be able to adjust the width of the views and the data visualizations about electric vehicle sales, charging stations, and battery range. Which type of layout will enable you to do that?**
   ```
   Horizontal layout
   ```
10. **Scenario 2, questions 10-15**
   <br/><br/>
   You have created your narrative and visuals, so now it’s time to build a professional and appealing slideshow. You choose a theme that matches the tone of your presentation. Then, you create a title slide with a title, subtitle, and the date. 
   <br/><br/>
   Next, you create the following slide that compares electric vehicle sales in 2015 and 2020:
   <br/><br/>
   ![Slides with bar chart of vehicle sales from 2015 and 2022. There are long descriptions at bottom of slide and next to chart.](/images/Course-challenge/28eac38a-f267-49e8-8f3d-7fcc03073571image3.png)
   <br/><br/>
   **Alt-text:** Slideshow with bar chart of electric vehicle sales from 2015 and 2022. 2022 had higher sales. There are also multiple sentences at the bottom of the slide and another piece of descriptive text near the chart.
   <br/><br/>
   **After reviewing your slide, you realize that it could be improved. What steps do you take to make the two text boxes beneath the header more effective? Select all that apply.**
   ```
   • Edit the text to fewer than five lines total
   • Ensure the text does not simply repeat the words you plan to say
   • Edit the text to fewer than 25 words total
   ```
11. **Scenario 2, continued**
     <br/><br/>
    You then create the following slide to demonstrate the challenges associated with battery range and charging stations:
    <br/><br/>
    ![Slideshow of a pie chart and United States map to demonstrate the challenges of car battery range and charging stations.](/images/Course-challenge/28eac38a-f267-49e8-8f3d-7fcc03073571image5.jpg)
    <br/><br/>
    **After reviewing your slide, you realize that the visual elements could be improved. Which of the following options would help you make the visual elements on this slide more effective? Select all that apply.**
    ```
    • Choose one data visualization to share on this slide, then create another slide for the second data visualization
    • Use a consistent font size and color for data visualization titles
    ```
12. **Scenario 2, continued**
    
    You complete your slideshow and share it with your team. Once it is approved by your supervisor, you prepare to give your presentation. You consider presentation best practices: maintaining good posture, being aware of nervous habits, and making eye contact. In addition, you think about how you will present your data visualizations.
    <br/><br/>
    **What strategies can help you explain the data visualizations effectively? Select all that apply.**
    ``` 
    • Use the five-second rule
    • Channel your excitement
    • Start with the broader ideas
    ```
13. **Scenario 2, continued**
    
    **Next, you prepare for the question-and-answer session that will follow your presentation. To predict what questions they may ask, you do a colleague test of your presentation. You should choose a colleague who has deep expertise in the electric vehicle industry.**
    ```
    False
    ```
14. **Scenario 2, continued**
    
    **Now that you have some idea of the questions the stakeholders may ask, you consider potential objections. How do you ensure you are prepared for any potential objections? Select all that apply.**
    ```
    • Include information on where the data came from in an appendix
    • Be sure to include numerous perspectives during the analysis process
    • Keep a detailed log of your data-cleaning process
    ```
15. **Scenario 2, continued**
    
    The big day has arrived, and you finish your presentation to the Gaea team. In the question-and-answer session, a stakeholder asks you a very detailed question about a car battery range project that's still in development.
    <br/><br/>
    **What strategies do you use in order to respond effectively? Select all that apply.**
    ```
    • Keep your response short and to the point, then add detail if there are follow-up questions
    • Involve the whole audience when you respond to the stakeholder
    • Be certain that you understand the context of the question that the stakeholder is asking
    ```
