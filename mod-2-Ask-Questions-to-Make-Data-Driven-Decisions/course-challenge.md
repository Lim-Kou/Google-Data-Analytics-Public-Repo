## Course challenge
1. **Scenario 1, questions 1-5**<br/><br/>

   You’ve just started a job as a data analyst at a small software company that provides data analytics and business intelligence solutions. Your supervisor asks you to kick off a project with a new client, Athena’s Story, a feminist bookstore. They have four existing locations, and the fifth shop has just opened in your community. <br/><br/>
   
   Athena’s Story wants to produce a campaign to generate excitement for an upcoming celebration and introduce the bookstore to the community. They share some data with your team to help make the event as successful as possible.<br/><br/>
   
   Your task is to review the assignment and the available data, then present your approach to your supervisor. Click the link below to access the email from your supervisor:<br/><br/>
   
   [course-challenge-Scenario-1-Email-from-Supervisor.pdf](supplementary-materials/course-challenge-Scenario-1-Email-from-Supervisor.pdf)<br/><br/>

   Then, review the email, and the Customer Survey and Historical Sales datasets.<br/><br/>
   
   To use the templates for the datasets, click the links below and select “Use Template.”<br/><br/>
   
   Links to templates: [Customer Survey](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HbBfNTuHCmQyY0GJrsdj6OCOkmeA5sUAQ-jXx8bMdpY/template/preview "link to make a copy of Google Sheets of customer survey data") and [Historical Sales](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HO8B-svc3Mmm3hlWycvX61Boxl9RQv6nKKWnkRig83E/template/preview "link to make a copy in Google Sheets of historical sales")<br/><br/>
   
   After reading the email, you notice that the acronym WHM appears in multiple places. You look it up online, and the most common result is web host manager. That doesn’t seem right to you, as it doesn’t fit the context of a feminist bookstore. **Still, you should assume it’s correct and continue with the project.**
   ```
   False
   ```

2. **Scenario 1 continued**<br/><br/>
   
   Now that you know WHM stands for Women’s History Month, you review the Customer Survey dataset which contains both qualitative and quantitative data.<br/><br/>
   
   To use the template for the dataset, click the link below and select “Use Template.”<br/><br/>
   
   Link to template: [Customer Survey](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HbBfNTuHCmQyY0GJrsdj6OCOkmeA5sUAQ-jXx8bMdpY/template/preview "link to make a copy in google sheets of customer survey data")<br/><br/>
   
   **The data in column F (Survey Q6: What types of books would you like to see more of at Athena's Story?) is quantitative.**
   ```
   False 
   ```

3. **Scenario 1 continued** <br/><br/>

   Next, you review the customer feedback in column F of the Customer Survey dataset.<br/><br/>
   
   To use the template for the dataset, click the link below and select “Use Template.”<br/><br/>
   
   Link to template: [Customer Survey](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HbBfNTuHCmQyY0GJrsdj6OCOkmeA5sUAQ-jXx8bMdpY/template/preview "link to make a copy in google sheets of customer survey data")<br/><br/>
   
   The attribute of column F is, “Survey Q6: What types of books would you like to see more of at Athena's Story?” In order to verify that children’s literature and feminist zines are among the most popular genres, you create a visualization. This will help you clearly identify which genres are most likely to sell well during the Women’s History Month campaign.<br/><br/>
   
   Your visualization looks like this:<br/><br/>
   
   **Pie chart categories:** Feminist science fiction 4.8% Books about women 2.4% Women's journals 2.4% Feminist literary criticism 2.4% Children's literature 15.5% Women's history books 2.4% Biographies of inspiration 20.2% Feminist fiction 26.2% Feminist zines 14.3% Feminist poetry 4.6% Feminist novels 3.6%<br/><br/>
   
   **The chart you create demonstrates the percentages of each book genre that make up the whole. It’s called an area chart.**
   ```
   False
   ```
   
4. Now that you’ve confirmed that children’s literature and feminist zines are among the most requested book genres, you review the Historical Sales dataset.<br/><br/>
   
   To use the template for the dataset, click the link below and select “Use Template.”<br/><br/>
   
   Link to template: [Historical Sales](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HO8B-svc3Mmm3hlWycvX61Boxl9RQv6nKKWnkRig83E/template/preview "link to make a copy in Google Sheets of historical sales")<br/><br/>

   You’re pleased to see that the dataset contains data that’s specific to children’s literature and feminist zines. This will provide you with the information you need to make data-inspired decisions. In addition, the children’s literature and feminist zines metrics will help you organize and analyze the data about each genre in order to determine if they’re likely to be profitable.<br/><br/>
   
   **Next, you calculate the total sales over 52 weeks for feminist zines. You type =CALCULATE(E2-E53) but get an error. What is the correct syntax?**
   ```
   =SUM(E2:E53)
   ```

5. **Scenario 1 continued**<br/><br/>

   After familiarizing yourself with the project and available data, you present your approach to your supervisor. You provide a scope of work, which includes important details, a schedule, and information on how you plan to prepare and validate the data. You also share some of your initial results and the pie chart you created.<br/><br/>
   
   In addition, you identify the problem type, or domain, for the data analysis project. You decide that the historical sales data can be used to provide insights into the types of books that will sell best during Women’s History Month this coming year. This will also enable you to determine if Athena’s Story should begin selling more children’s literature and feminist zines.<br/><br/>
   
   **Using historical data to make informed decisions about how things may be in the future is an example of making predictions.**
   ```
   True
   ```

6. **Scenario 2, questions 6-10**<br/><br/>

   You’ve completed this program and are now interviewing for your first junior data analyst position. You’re hoping to be hired by an event planning company, Patel Events Plus. Access the job description below:<br/><br/>

   [course-challenge-Scenario-2-Junior-Data-Analyst-Job-Description.pdf](supplementary-materials/course-challenge-Scenario-2-Junior-Data-Analyst-Job-Description.pdf)<br/><br/>
   
   So far, you’ve successfully completed the first round of interviews with the human resources manager and director of data and strategy. Now, the vice president of data and strategy wants to learn more about your approach to managing projects and clients. Access the email you receive from the human resources director below:<br/><br/>
   
   You arrive Thursday at 1:45 PM for your 2 PM interview. Soon, you’re taken into the office of Mila Aronowicz, vice president of data and strategy. After welcoming you, she begins the behavioral interview.<br/><br/>

   [course-challenge-Scenario-2-Patel-Event-Plus-Org-Char.pdf](supplementary-materials/course-challenge-Scenario-2-Patel-Event-Plus-Org-Char.pdf)<br/><br/>
   
   As you’ve learned in this course, stakeholders are people who invest time, interest, and resources into the projects you’ll be working on as a data analyst. Let’s say you’re working on a project involving data and strategy.<br/><br/>
   
   **Based on what you find in the organizational chart, which individuals are considered  the secondary stakeholders? Select all that apply.**
   ```
   • Data analytics coordinator
   • Project manager, analytics
   • Director, data analytics 
   ```

   Next, the vice president wants to understand your knowledge about asking effective questions. Consider and respond to the following question. Select all that apply.<br/><br/>
   
   **Let’s say we just completed a big event for a client and wanted to find out if they were satisfied with their experience. Provide some examples of measurable questions that you could include in the customer feedback survey. Select all that apply.**
   ```
   • How satisfied were you with our event planning service — dissatisfied, neutral, or satisfied?
   • On a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being not at all likely and 5 being very likely, how likely are you to recommend Patel Events Plus?
   ```

8. **Scenario 2 continued**<br/><br/>

   Now, the vice president presents a situation having to do with resolving challenges and meeting stakeholder expectations. Consider and respond to the following question.<br/><br/>
   
   **You’re working on a rush project, and you discover your dataset is not clean. Even though it has numerous nulls, redundant data, and other issues, the primary stakeholder insists that you move ahead and use it anyway. The project timeline is so tight that there simply isn’t enough time for cleaning. How would you handle that situation?**
   ```
   Communicate the situation to your supervisor and ask for advice on how to handle the situation with the stakeholder.
   ```

9. **Scenario 2 continued**<br/><br/>

   Your next interview question deals with sharing information with stakeholders. Consider and respond to the following question. Select all that apply.<br/><br/>
   
   **Let’s say you’ve created a report to present stakeholders with information about an upcoming event. Describe the benefits of using a report. Select all that apply.**
   ```   
   • Reports reflect data that’s already been cleaned and sorted.
   • Reports provide a snapshot of high-level, historical data.
   ```

10. **Scenario 2 continued**<br/><br/>
